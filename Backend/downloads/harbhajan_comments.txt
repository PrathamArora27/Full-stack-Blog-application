Title: Harbhajan comments
Content: Harbhajan Singh took the example of India winning the Border-Gavaskar tournament as an example to show Kohli's greatness as a test captain. 

"You may not have won a World Cup under Kohli's captaincy but it doesn't make him a lesser captain or lesser player. The fire that he ignited in the team, like it may be a target of 400 in the fourth innings of a Test, we'll go for the chase, we won't panic. If we go down, we do it while chasing. It takes a lot of guts and brain, which Kohli has instilled in the team," said Harbhajan Singh.
